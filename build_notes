// give five simulations, range in complexity, several iterations + grids - only few minutes to run
// from easy to hard, schedule
// 64 cores analysis, gpufi - 4
// 3dmhd parameter + 3dmhd set (have terabyet to terabyte of free space)
more makefile (check file)
Can do thousands of iterations
Checkpoint in 3dmhdset.f (using command ll)
FINP = ‘1test3d1’ to set checkpoint
More 1test3d1 to check the simulation details
They will tell us which part can be changed which cannot be changed
